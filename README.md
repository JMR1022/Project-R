# Project-R
R project for NYCDSA
 

The data set I selected focuses on peopleâ€™s stress levels and different factors in their lives that can contribute to raising or lowering it. 

This project is a R shiny app about stress and different supports they have.

- You can customize the graph by year and gender. The year spans from 2015-2021 and the gender categories are male and female. 
- Starting in the upper left corner, that graph is showing the different age groups and the daily stress levels they experience from 0 to 5. 
- The upper right-hand graph shows their support system, and how many people they feel they are close to and can confide in. 
- The lower left-hand graph shows the time spent in hours on weekly meditation. 
- The last graph is divided up by age group comparing stress levels to the daily number of hours spent on passions/enjoyable activities.
